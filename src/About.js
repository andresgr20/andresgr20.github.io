                <p>I am a recent graduate of the University of Waterloo with a keen interest in fintech, social innovation, and education. Some of my hobbies are reading, live music, game design, hiking, photography, and learning new languages. I am currently fluent in Spanish and English, and am slowly trying to pick up Japanese and Portuguese again. I was born and raised on a ranch, so I am hoping to one day create a bridge between tech and farming for Second World countries.Â     </p>
