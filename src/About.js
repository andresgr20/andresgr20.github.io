                <p>I am a recent Waterloo university graduate with a keen interest in fintech, social innovation, and education. Some of my hobbies are reading, live music, game design, hiking, photography, and learning new languages. I am currently fluent in Spanish and English, and slowly trying to pick up Japanese and Portuguese again. I was born and raised in a ranch and later moved to one day merge tech and farming.Â     </p>
